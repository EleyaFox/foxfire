            Our first day as a team was marvelous! "Great minds think alike" -feeling was sure there. It only 
            took us few hours to come up with idea, theme and all relevant stuff for the game. We decided to 
            have japanese theme and releations from japanese folklore. Our goal was very ambitious. We wanted to make 
            a game that has fully hand drawn characters, frame by frame animations and parallax background. We also 
            wanted to have dialogues, hidden places, cutscenes and voice actors. Currently latter are not implemented yet. Although
            there is voice actor for main villain and owl already.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started first to create a placeholder level and moving character so we could try our code someway. We had decided 
            that Anu would do background and Taru would draw the main character and do the animationos. I would try to make main 
            villain and his right hand. I totally don't know how to draw with computer yet so this was overwhelming task for me. 
            I'm still trying to make them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weeks gone by and we created good and not so good code for the game. Last efforts for optimizing the code, animations 
            and first level (including main menu and level one complete-screen) was intense. The day when we were to present demo 
            version and our greatest pride for our class and teachers draw near. We all were so nervous and me too. Just before 
            the presentations, we managed to get the game and website for good condition. It al went quite well.
          </p>

            I personally learned a lot! I mean really a lot about game making with Unity and C#. I will continue this awesome jorney 
            to become a great gmae developer. I thank my team and my friends who helped. Especially Kimmo Seitz who made music and 
            sound effects!
