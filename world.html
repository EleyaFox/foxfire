        The story takes place in a strongly Japanese-themed world, driving inspiration from Japanese nature,
        folklore, culture and architecture. The characters traverse vibrant meadows, lush forests and grand
        mountain ranges through the story, yet no humans can be found - even while old buildings litter
        the landscape and rice paddies line the mountainsides. It is an alternate dimension where spirits 
        and animals take the stage and life is intrinsically bound with the mystical. Each level represents 
        a part of the four seasons, beginning from the budding leaves and cherry blossoms of early spring
        and ending in the cold and harsh darkness of late winter. The world grows progressively darker
        and colder towards the end without losing itsâ€™ wonder and beauty. The nature around the character
        is alive with animal sounds and the rustling of leaves, treasures to be found and with secrets to
        be discovered in hidden pathways.
