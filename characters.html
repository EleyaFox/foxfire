            <h3>Kitsu</h3>
            <p>
              The main character in the game is named as Kitsu, which comes from Japanese term “kitsune”, 
              meaning simply “a fox”. Its tails, foxfires and all of her talents all come from old Japanese folklores. 
              Kitsu’s appearance is designed by the team. Kitsu looks a fennec like fox with big ears, golden fur and 
              comparably little body. Kitsu is a female, and she 
              has kind but playful personality. Unlike other animals in the game, she cannot talk before she has 
              acquired her missing foxfires and her tails back from the evil villain, Tachi the Mage. 
              After her year lasting journey, which we see in the game, Kitsu encounters Tachi the Mage and battles him to 
              get her lost foxfires back to acquire her last lost tail. With 9 tails, which is the maximum amount of 
              tails to a kitsune, she can finally transform to beautiful woman, and talk. The first things she says 
              is to thank her friends who helped her with her long journey.

            <h3>Tachi the Mage</h3>
            <p>The story’s main villain is a Japanese weasel called Tachi the Mage, who has lived over 900 years and 
              has developed himself powerful yokai skills. Tachi was jealous of Kitsu’s tails and skills so he used 
              his own skills to steal main character Kitsu’s foxfires, what he knew was the source of his power. 
              Tachi’s goal is to rule the animal world with his right hand, Beef the Bear. Since they saw the main 
              protagonist as a threat, Tachi and his lieutenants scattered the foxfires all over the country and 
              placed guardians near them so Kitsu could never get them back. Tachi can change forms between human 
              monk and weasel. Tachi is a vile and a wicked person and he is always scheming. He thinks that everyone 
              should follow only his rules or face a painful and gruesome death!
